# 🔴 RESTART REQUIRED - Backend Changes

## Problem

The backend server is returning 500 errors on all endpoints because:

1. ✅ We added new chat routes (`operations_chat.py`)
2. ✅ We added new database models (`ChatSession`, `ChatMessage`)
3. ✅ We registered the new router in `app.py`
4. ❌ **But the backend server hasn't been restarted yet**

The old backend process is still running without the new code.

## Solution

**You must restart the backend server** to load the new chat functionality.

---

## Step-by-Step Restart

### 1. Stop Current Backend

**Find the backend process:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
# Look for the PID (last column) - currently PID 8428

# Kill it
taskkill /F /PID 8428
```

Or if you're running it in a terminal, just press `Ctrl+C` in that terminal window.

### 2. Start Backend Fresh

**In the backend terminal:**
```bash
cd server
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. Verify Backend is Running

**Test health endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"ok":true,"app":"OpenInbox OpsManager AI","database":"connected"}
```

### 4. Test Chat Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/operations-chat/sessions
```

Expected response:
```json
{"sessions":[]}
```

## What Changed in Backend

### New Files:
- `server/routes/operations_chat.py` - Chat API routes
- `server/alembic/versions/002_add_chat_tables.py` - Database migration

### Modified Files:
- `server/app.py` - Added chat router
- `server/models.py` - Added ChatSession and ChatMessage models

### Database:
- Tables already created in PostgreSQL
- No migration needed (already ran `create_all`)

---

## After Restart

Once backend is restarted:

1. ✅ All 500 errors should be gone
2. ✅ Chat should work properly
3. ✅ Tasks, delegations, and email triage should all work
4. ✅ Daily digest should load

---

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Backend stopped (kill process on port 8000)
- [ ] Backend restarted with uvicorn
- [ ] Health endpoint returns OK
- [ ] Frontend loads without 500 errors
- [ ] Chat button works
- [ ] Can send/receive chat messages

---

## Why This Happened

When we added the chat feature:
1. We created new Python files
2. We modified existing files
3. **But FastAPI doesn't auto-reload for new route files**
4. The running process doesn't know about `operations_chat.py`

Even though `--reload` is used, it only reloads changes to already-imported files, not new routers that were added after the server started.

---

## Current Status

**Backend:** Running old code (PID 8428)
**Database:** ✅ Running and healthy
**Frontend:** ✅ Running on port 3001
**Tables:** ✅ Created in PostgreSQL

**Action Required:** RESTART BACKEND to load new chat code

---

## Alternative: Use the Start Script

If you have a startup script:
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C or kill PID)

# Start fresh
cd server
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

That's it! After restart, everything should work. 🎉
