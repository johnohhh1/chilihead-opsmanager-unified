# üå∂Ô∏è CHILIHEAD OPSMANAGER - NEXT STEPS

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** Working but needs improvements

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING NOW

1. **Gmail OAuth** - Port 8002, authenticated
2. **Email Triage** - Shows emails from watched senders
3. **AI Analysis** - GPT-4 analyzes individual emails
4. **Daily Brief** - Now ACTUALLY reads Gmail (was hardcoded, fixed!)
5. **Date Filter Dropdown** - Today, Yesterday, Week, Month, All
6. **Delegations Tab** - ChiliHead 5-pillar system functional

---

## üö® CURRENT ISSUES

### **1. Only Showing 5 Emails** 
- Backend configured to fetch 200, but only 5 showing
- Possible causes:
  - OpenAI 10s timeout hitting during fetch
  - Frontend limiting display
  - Priority filter too aggressive
- **NEEDS INVESTIGATION**

### **2. No Specific Date Picker**
- Only has presets (today, week, etc.)
- **NEED:** Actual date input fields for custom ranges
- Gmail API supports: `after:2025/10/01 before:2025/10/15`
- Can also use Unix timestamps for precision

### **3. No Settings/Preferences Panel**
- Can't manage watched senders/domains from UI
- No way to adjust fetch limits
- No API key management interface
- **THIS IS CRITICAL** for making it production-ready

---

## üìã PRIORITY TODO LIST

### **üî• HIGH PRIORITY (Do These First)**

1. **Fix the 5-Email Limit**
   - Debug why only 5 showing despite fetching 200
   - Add loading progress indicators
   - Check for timeout issues

2. **Add Specific Date Range Picker**
   ```typescript
   - Add date input fields (from/to)
   - Support YYYY/MM/DD format for Gmail API
   - Allow switching between presets and custom dates
   - Update backend to handle date_from/date_to params
   ```

3. **Build Settings/Preferences Panel**
   ```
   - Tab or modal for settings
   - Manage watched senders/domains (add/remove from UI)
   - Configure fetch limits (50, 100, 200, 500)
   - Set default time range
   - Toggle features on/off
   - API key management
   ```

### **üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY**

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add pagination for large result sets
   - Show "Loading X of Y emails..." progress
   - Cache email data locally
   - Lazy load email bodies

5. **Better Error Handling**
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Retry failed requests
   - Handle rate limits gracefully

6. **UI Polish**
   - Loading skeletons
   - Better empty states
   - Improved mobile responsiveness

### **üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Future)**

7. **Unbranding & Generalization**
   - Remove Chili's-specific branding
   - Make it industry-agnostic
   - Add customizable themes
   - Multi-user support

8. **Advanced Features**
   - Email scheduling/reminders
   - Smart categorization with ML
   - Integration with more tools (Slack, Teams, etc.)
   - Analytics dashboard

```

### To Add New Time Range:
```python

## üéØ VISION (After It Works Perfectly)

**Goal:** Best-in-class Operations Management platform

**Target Users:**
- Restaurant managers (like current use)
- Retail store managers
- Service business operators
- Team leaders with high email volume

**Key Differentiators:**
- AI understands CONTEXT, not just keywords
- Extracts actionable items automatically
- Integrates delegation system
- Clean, focused UX

**Revenue Model (Future):**
- Freemium (basic features free)
- Pro tier ($10/mo): unlimited emails, advanced AI
- Business tier ($50/mo): team features, analytics
- White label licensing

## üìù NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

- User (John) is frustrated when things don't work
- Expects current, accurate data (not hardcoded!)
- Wants to experiment and iterate
- Has a working version elsewhere but this is dev branch
- Focus on making it work perfectly for his use case FIRST
- Then generalize and unbrand

**Remember:** This is a merge of two projects still being refined. Some features may be broken/incomplete. That's expected during development!
